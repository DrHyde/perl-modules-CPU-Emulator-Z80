=head1 OPERATING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

=head2 HARDWARE

There is 64K of memory and maximum of 256 ports.  Input ports are
arranged in pairs - the first of each pair, when read, will tell
how many bytes are available to be read.  The second is where
actual data is available.

=head3 PORTS

=head4 OUTPUT

=over

=item 0 - mem_bank

Write either 0, 1, 2 or 3 to indicate which chunk of memory to bank
(meaning the 16K chunk starting at N * 0x4000) following by a byte
indicating which ROM or which extra chunk of RAM to map in.

=item 1 - mem_unbank

Write either 0, 1, 2 or 3 to indicate which chunk of memory to unbank.

=item 2 - io_wr_stdout

Write a byte to the host machine's STDOUT.

=item 0xFF - hw_start_clock

Starts the machine clock.  The clock generates NMIs.  Writing anything
to this port works.

=back

=head4 INPPUT

=head2 BOOT LOADER

The machine starts with PC = 0x0000, the Boot ROM paged in at 0x0000
and the OS ROM paged in at 0x4000.

The Boot loader first copies some code to the top of memory, then
jumps to it.  That code disables the Boot ROM, copies the first
256 bytes of the OS from the OS ROM to 0x0000, disables the
OS ROM, starts the clock, then jumps to 0x0000.

=head2 BOOTING THE OS

There's just a few bytes 0x0000, and a jump past the RST block.

The stack is initialised and the memory-map reset.

It then reads each port in turn until no more data are available,
flushing them.  The various bits of memory reserved for the OS are
then marked as such in the memory map.  Finally, the file
C<shell.cmd> is executed.

=head1 REGISTERS

The alternate register set may be used by OS functions.  Any
functions that do so are un-interruptable.

=head1 MEMORY MAP

    0xFF80 to 0xFFFF: stack
    0xFF00 to 0xFF7F: memory allocation bitmap
                      each bit represents 64 bytes
    ...
    0x0000 to 0xXXXX: OS code

=head1 ACCESS TO OS FUNCTIONS

Parameters are passed via the stack, and are all sixteen bits long
The last parameter passed should be the function number to call.
To execute the function, C<RST 1>.  This preserves all registers.
RST 1 itself is not re-entrant.

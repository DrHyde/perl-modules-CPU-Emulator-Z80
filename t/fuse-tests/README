These tests are taken from the FUSE emulator:
  http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/

The files tests.in and tests.expected are the Z80 tests as supplied
with FUSE version 0.9.0.  The *.yml files are those test inputs and
outputs converted to YAML.

I am very grateful to Philip Kendall for letting me use them.

The complete original FUSE distribution can be found here:

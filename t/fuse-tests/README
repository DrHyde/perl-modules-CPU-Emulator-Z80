These tests are taken from the FUSE emulator:
  http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/

The original README is renamed as FUSE-README.  The files tests.in
and tests.expected are the Z80 tests as supplied with FUSE.  The
*.yml files are those test inputs and outputs converted to YAML.

I am very grateful to Philip Kendall for letting me use them.
